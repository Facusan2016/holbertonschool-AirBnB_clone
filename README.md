## Resources

The next list is composed of useful resources that were provided to us for make this project.

 - [Cmd Module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/cmd.html)
 - [Uuid Module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/uuid.html)
 - [Datetime Module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/datetime.html)
 - [Unittest Module](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)

## Libraries used

Some of the libraries that we used are described on the next list

|Library|Way that it was used|
|-------|--------------------|
|Cmd| A module that provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters|
|Uuid| This module provide us a simple way to generate an unique id to each object in our program, in this case we used uuid4.|
|Datetime| Using Datetime gave us an easier way to manage when each object was created or modified, on the BaseClass we used it in ```created_at``` and ```updated_at``` attributes.|
|Unittest| Using unittest made possible to test our program on each aspect|

## How to install and how to use it

To use this project locally you have to execute the next command on your local terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Facusan2016/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone
```
It's important to have python3 interpreter installed for being able to execute the main program that is ```console.py``` this will bring up a command line interface called “hbnb”.
We can use various commands to interact with classes and objects.

## Commands available

To next commands are available to interact with our console.

|Command| Functionality|
|-------|--------------|
|create <ClassName>| Create a new instance of the class we want.|
|show <ClassName> <ObjectID>| Shows the details of a specific instance of the class, in this example it would be the ClassName or the ObjectID|
|destroy <ClassName> <ObjectID>|Deletes a specific instance of the class, for example ClassName or ObjectID|
|all <ClassName>| Shows all instances of the class we want.|
|update <ClassName> <ObjectID> <AttributeName> <AttributeValue> | Updates an attribute of an instance, whatever we want.|

You can exit the program by typing quit.
